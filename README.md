# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_MAVEN_MARKET_DATA

The Maven Market dataset offers a rich collection of retail data spanning transactions, customers, stores, products, returns, and regions. It enabled to explore and analyze real-world business performance metrics, including sales trends, customer behavior, and return patterns across different markets. Conducted an in-depth sales performance analysis on the Maven Market dataset by writing and executing optimized SQL queries. The project involved integrating multiple relational tables - including Transactions, Customers, Products, Stores, Returns, and Regions - to uncover key trends, sales cycles, and customer behavior patterns. Emphasis was placed on evaluating overall business performance through metrics such as sales volume, return rates, regional performance, and product demand. This SQL-driven analysis provided actionable insights into the cyclical nature of sales and highlighted areas for strategic business improvements. This project was successfully complete with the guidance of UNP(United Network of Professionals).
